The classes and files in this folder have now been moved to a seperate git
repository.

To get them with git:
	In terminal cd to this directories superdir (phocoa/external)
	then clone from github
	git clone git://github.com/SwissalpS/SwissalpSphp.git

To get them with curl or wget:
	the url is: https://SwissalpS@github.com/SwissalpS/SwissalpSphp.git

To download from browser, visit https://github.com/SwissalpS/SwissalpSphp
	and click the Download button...


To create a new SwissalpS-PHOCOA application, you can use the commandline script:
	SwissalpSphp/_synergize/PHOCOA/SssSphocoaGenTemplates/SssSphocoaApp/SssSphocoaGen/newSssSphocoaProject

	this will walk you through the setup. In the newly created
	project directory/SssSphocoaGen there will be
		useMeAsTemplate.plist
		useTemplateThatMadeMe.plist

	you can use these to create clones, with a speedier setup.

	on Mac: drag the plist onto newSssSphocoaProjectFromPlist.app

	from cli: pass the plist path as argument for newSssSphocoaProject

more info about the SssSphocoaGen templating system is found in:
	infoSwissalpSPhocoaTemplates.txt
