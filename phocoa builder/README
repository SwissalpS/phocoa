BUGS:
- UNDO doesn't work in Inspector panels...
- Clean round-tripping of quoted values... syck/php will turn Yes into (bool) Yes so we have to "Yes" in Phocoa BUilder. But then on re-open PHOCOA Builder drops the "".

TODO:

CHANGELOG:
- [Cannot reproduce; seems to work] Escaping for ':'
- [DONE - disabled prefs menu item for now in case it's needed again...] The preference for php command is probably no longer needed, unless we want to build-in the YAML converter
- [DONE] Ability to toggle inspectors?
