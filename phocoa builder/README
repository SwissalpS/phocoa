BUGS:

1. Clicking around a lot on the pages (use test module -- click detail, edit, detail) will crash. CFArray index log item when click on EDIT... maybe that's it.

(seems resolved)


TODO:

1. Get page instances hierarchy add / add child / remove buttons working.
2. Why doesn't undo work when the panels are FOCUSED? Works if we focus the main window, but not if we focus on a panel.
3. Saving back out to all appropriate files.
4. Editable / Saveable .tpl editing.
5. Ability to toggle inspectors?
6. IMPORTANT:: Make the order of keys in the output file consistent to minimize the "diff" when only one item is changed.
