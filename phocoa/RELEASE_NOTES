Version 0.1.1
- [BC-break] WFYAHOO is now an abstract class. Some applications may have previously instantiated WFYAHOO objects to bootstrap the YUI lib. This will now break.
             To update, you should remove any WFYAHOO instances from your application and instead use the {YUI} smarty plugin, which utilizes the new YUILoader support.
- [new] Ajax infrastructure has been added to PHOCOA. Refer to docs for details, as it is a big system.
