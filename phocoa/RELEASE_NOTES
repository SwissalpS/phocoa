Version 0.1.7 - ???
- [bugfix] Custom action methods on WFSubmit widgets now work in conjunction with WFForm.isAjax. Previously the "default" action name was always used even if a custom action was specified.

Version 0.1.6 - 8/7/2008
- [bc-break] The "onEvent: <event> do j:" syntax was updated so that it no longer stops the javascript event by default. If you want to stop the javascript event now, 
  do "this.stopEvent(event);" inside of your "j:" handler.
- [new] Added WFFixture class to handle loading of fixture data via YAML files.
- [bugfix] WFSelect now treats all values as type string, thus fixing a problem where options "" and "0" were not treated as distinct values.

Version 0.1.5 - 7/24/2008
NOTE: need to look up a better list of improvements made since 0.1.4. Not sure how...
- [new] WFSensitiveDataFormatter makes it easy to X-out parts of strings.
- [bugfix] WFSelect now works properly when using options bindings in conjunction with InsertNullPlaceholder.
- [new] Update to FCKeditor 2.6.
- [new] Update to YUI 2.5.2.

Version 0.1.4
- [new] Appcelerator integration.
- [new] Replace spyc integration with Horde/Yaml.
- [new] WFYAHOO_widget_YahooScript for including YAHOO-dependent Javascript on your pages.
- [new] Ability to have the "default page" of a module accept parameters without specifying the page name in the invocation path. Must implement module::allPages() to enable.
- [new] Added WFPostletUpload, which is a widget that offers a Java applet for bulk-uploading files to phocoa apps via drag-n-drop.
- [bugfix] Phocoa now works properly when accessed from behind proxy servers.
- [new] Added readline support to the phocoa shell, if you have it installed in your PHP. This adds history and auto-complete support, although history isn't working reliably.
- [new] Added ability to customize respondsToForms from WFSkinModuleView.
- 

Version 0.1.1
- [BC-break] WFYAHOO is now an abstract class. Some applications may have previously instantiated WFYAHOO objects to bootstrap the YUI lib. This will now break.
             To update, you should remove any WFYAHOO instances from your application and instead use the {YUI} smarty plugin, which utilizes the new YUILoader support.
- [BC-break] If you are using WFArrayController with USE_ARRAY_INDEXES_AS_ID (#arrayIndexes#), by default your array controllers will break,
             due to the new avoidsEmptySelection property, which is true by default. To fix this, either convert your array controllers
             to use ids, or set avoidsEmptySelection to false.
- [new] Ajax infrastructure has been added to PHOCOA. Refer to docs for details, as it is a big system.
