- [new] WFYAHOO_widget_YahooScript for including YAHOO-dependent Javascript on your pages.
- [new] Ability to have the "default page" of a module accept parameters without specifying the page name in the invocation path. Must implement module::allPages() to enable.
- [new] Added WFPostletUpload, which is a widget that offers a Java applet for bulk-uploading files to phocoa apps via drag-n-drop.
- [bugfix] Phocoa now works properly when accessed from behind proxy servers.
- [new] Added readline support to the phocoa shell, if you have it installed in your PHP. This adds history and auto-complete support, although history isn't working reliably.

Version 0.1.1
- [BC-break] WFYAHOO is now an abstract class. Some applications may have previously instantiated WFYAHOO objects to bootstrap the YUI lib. This will now break.
             To update, you should remove any WFYAHOO instances from your application and instead use the {YUI} smarty plugin, which utilizes the new YUILoader support.
- [BC-break] If you are using WFArrayController with USE_ARRAY_INDEXES_AS_ID (#arrayIndexes#), by default your array controllers will break,
             due to the new avoidsEmptySelection property, which is true by default. To fix this, either convert your array controllers
             to use ids, or set avoidsEmptySelection to false.
- [new] Ajax infrastructure has been added to PHOCOA. Refer to docs for details, as it is a big system.
