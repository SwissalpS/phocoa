README for the Cocoa-Style PHP Framework (PHOCOA)

Both CLI and HTTP access to functionality is available. In the HTTP environment, everything is bootstrapped automatically, you need only write WFModule subclasses to add request handlers. On the CLI side, there is now an autoload mechanism in place. To bootstrap the PHOCOA environment, you need only include the webapp.conf file at the top of the CLI script. We recommend setting up and ENV PHOCOA_PROJECT_CONF with the absolute path to the webapp.conf file and then using this at the top of all CLI scripts:

require $_ENV['PHOCOA_PROJECT_CONF'];

This will bootstrap the web application, load the application delegate, etc. PHOCOA's autoload mechanism will then call into your app to allow you to provide autoloading for your systems.

?? Eventually this could be wrapped in a phing script that figures out the current project and automatically sets this ENV and calls your script.

-------------------------------

Dependencies
1) PHP5
2) Propel is nice (http://propel.phpdb.org)
3) Pear Packages
- Mail
- Mail_Mime
- Log
4) Phing
5) YUI: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui
--> To upgrade the YUI, download it from YAHOO, then:
rsync --dry-run -vvr ~/Desktop/yui-1/build/ ~/dev/sandbox/phocoa/phocoa/wwwroot/www/framework/yui
** when happy, remove --dry-run
** when done, edit yahoo.js, yahoo-min.js, and yahoo-dom-event.js to put the YAHOO var in the global namespace:
var YAHOO = {};
becomes
window.YAHOO = {};


TODO

1.0 Milestone:
- Maybe phocoa shouldn't "take over" entire /WWWROOT/ URL path. Instead, just let people drop modules wherever, and those pages should start with:
  require('../conf/webapp.conf');
  WFWebApplicationMain();
  // WFModule subclass here
  - this way we could store css, img, etc in the same folder as the module...
- Idea to get stuff in TPL file into <head> section! Create a {WFHead} block tag and have it addHeadString() if there's a skin; dump directly if not.
- Implement caching
  - NOTE: I started to play with this a little, returning a cache from WFModuleInvocation::execute() as a test, but it wasn't any faster! Need to profile a bit to see WTF.
  - Each module/page should determine whether or not it's cacheable (via a callback), and for how long, etc
  - store modulepage caches in runtime/
  - benchmark?
- Something seems slightly off with binding options setup. When bind() is done, seems that it should coalesce default binding option, but it isn't. They're being done
  all over the place (pullBindings, processBindingOptions, etc). Seems that the bind() process should coalesce those for you. What does processBindingOptions do anyway?
- Can we add "NullPlaceholder" to text field and text area so there can be some "help" text that gets automatically "converted" to/from NULL?
- Have the newproject script make -dev and -production and -staging versions of conf files
- Do we need namespacing for modules? What if you have 2 "included" modules on a page that both have a widget with id=name? Things won't work right... right?
- E_STRICT support
- Improve 'default' template to a nice-looking
    - Ubertemplate
    - Menu based on YUI
      - WFTreeController
- Integrate YAHOO js library to the extent that events can be attached to widgets; build a nice infrastructure for that
  - deprecate current js action handlers? dunno...
  - support tooltips on all wfview objects
- Outline and Document Naming Conventions for widgets to use for javascript functions, id, etc
- Decide on convention for loading JS files; should widgets document the needed files and require modules to load them, or should they try to always do it themselves?
  - Seem to have a good way to load JS/CSS for widgets with the PHOCOA. stuff, but what about loading phocoa.js and prototype.js? Skin? Require modules to do it?
- Add remember me support to login module; make sure needed support is in session code; test
- Add pear channel support for installation
  - dependencies; propel, phing, creole, etc
- WFRequestControllerDelegate -> has callbacks to process paths before default option; allows people to implement URI mapping, pre-processing, error handlers (404) etc
  -> Add WFRequestControllerException system; 404, 302, etc by throwing exceptions. How does this impact current WFRedirectRequestException?
- Fix bug in base64_encode -- this is *NOT* URL safe as base64 uses / character! see WFModule / showcase EncryptionUtil hexencode/hexdecode
- Make sure that the "page life cycle" is working most effectively. I am not positive I am happy with the order that things occur. This is mostly because of WFDynamic and the need to call createWidgets() over again? Maybe need additional callbacks? so that one can be sure that restoreState() is done, or that all dynamic widgets are made, etc?
  - Should there exist a class WFModulePage that is the "page-centric" stuff of a module? This would allow for better documentation of page-life-cycle callbacks
    - would more cleanly encapsulate pages: great place to put callbacks for page-centric things rather than goofily named methods of modules;
    - BC issues? could use __call on module to to DB?
    - could data still be easily/cleanly shared?
  - additional life cycle callbacks? look through page setup and do one for each major phase?
  - maybe have WFDynamic's "observe" arrayControllers and automatically update themselves... also have "WFArrayController::stopSendingUpdates()" and WFArrayController::startSendingUpdates" (find cocoa equivalent)
- Figure out a way to implement .ibpalette type functionality
  -> Creating widget bundles that are drop-in compatible
  -> Figure out better way for re-using modules so that they can be used as widgets of other pages: tricky life-cycle consequences
  -> Basic idea that pages and views are handled the same way.
- I18N infrastructure -> Like Cocoa; WFLocalizedStringForString:
  - thoughts:
  - each module should be localized independently; thus a module's dir structure would look like:
    myModule/
            myModule.php
            English.lproj/
                shared.instances
                shared.config
                myPage.instances
                myPage.config
                myPage.tpl
                Localizable.strings
            French.lproj
                shared.instances
                shared.config
                myPage.instances
                myPage.config
                myPage.tpl
                Localizable.strings
    - the current locale can be tracked by session?
    - there probably needs to be a place for "app-wide" .strings files, so common strings can be handled in one place instead of multiple places. maybe a Localized.strings/ folder at the root (where skins and modules etc are) that can be easily accessed from any module via WFLocalizedString("my string") will search Localized.strings first, then Application.strings
    - smarty plugin for accessing localized strings from smarty
    - improve the WF*DateFormatters to include "short,medium,long,full" default formats for each locale; timeFormat / dateFormat settings as alternatives to formatString (whose default would now be %X %x where %X=localized date and %x=localized time
    - improve the WFNumberFormatters to be automatic based on locale
    - ability to point the system to particular .strings file for generic localization; for instance, a set of localizations may be provided for database data, and a propel getDescription() accessor may be overridden to translate the data from the DB based on a .strings file
    - need to be able to localize skins too, I suppose...
    - need some convention for localizing images, css, etc, for both skins and modules

- Add page->setTemplateFile() to allow system to use alternate .tpl file -- easier for confirm/thanks pages that can share data with another page w/o passing data via module instance vars just to be re-assigned to the $page in the other page. DONE
- Add an interactive PHP shell for exploring your projects. DONE
- Add a WFViewPhocoaBuilderIntegration interface to house the informal protocol for making the PHOCOA builder more useful; add support to all widgets. DONE
- Move .config and .instances files to YAML to improve compatibility for people managing with text files and make other GUI editors easier to write. DONE
  - Convert existing projects to YAML setup with new converters. DONE
  - Update PHOCOA Builder to use syck/yaml parser directly, thus skipping the PHP interaction to read the files. DONE
- (DONE) Can we add a "module search path"? This would be used so that we can search for modules along multiple filesystem paths, and thus wouldn't need to copy framework modules
  into project directories. See WFWebApplication::addModulePath()
- (DONE) prototypes for the WFDynamic controls so you can "configure" the default setup for a widget in a table, matrix, etc
- Improve bindings support:
    - (DONE) Read only...
    - (DONE) Single Value Binding (currently what we do)
    - (DONE) Multi-Value Bindings (automatically read-only)
        - (DONE) Boolean: enabled && enabled2 && enabled3, OR hidden || hidden2 || hidden3
        - (DONE) Pattern: Ability to craft strings together from multiple values, a la formatstring: value="#%1% of %2% selected." The formatstring is set in the binding option "ValuePattern".
        - (NA) Argument: for target-action: can call a selector with multiple arguments (not required b/c our actions don't currently accept any arguments)
- (DONE) Array operators: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Concepts/ArrayOperators.html
- (DONE) Skins should be attached to the root invocation, not to the request. This way one can access the skin for the current module rather than only for the "current request".
- (DONE) Need to make "skin" available from page. For things like email and sub-modules the "skin" desired is different, but widgets and such need to be able to add to "head" element etc. Figure something out for that.
- (DONE) Add new project support for httpd.conf vs. .htaccess (via RewriteRule)
- (DONE) Change setup of wwwroot/www/framework; instead of cp -R, maybe use a httpd.conf directive or a RewriteRule or a symlink to avoid having to "sync" the framework stuff?

PERFORMANCE THINGS:
- WFLog is SLOW! Because PEAR/Log is slow, and it's also inefficient (calls WFWebApplication::sharedWebApplication() a lot). We can probably use a lightweight custom logger.
- Spyc is SLOW! Try using the syck extension where possible
--> These two items are about 30% of exec time

WFState -- idea for a simple widget to help stuff state in a form. Would simply serialize passed data and put it into a hidden var... and restore state! with bindings!
WFTabView -- rename to WFTabbedFormPanel? It must be in a form, and uses restoreState() from WFWidget, so this would make sense... also, remove "non-onepage" mode as we'll use a WFTabbedNavigationView for that.

WFSession - still needs to be designed. The current design sucks.

The page cycle is still really tricky... look at this further... ideas:
1) Do we need a callback for "noaction?" or is "if ($page->hasSubmittedForm())" good enough inside of _PageDidLoad?
2) Do we need more hooks? Do things happen in the right order? The way things are created, restored, etc, seems fragile. Light hacking occuring to make it work in some situations.

ARCHITECTURAL THINGS TO INVESTIGATE
Use of FilterIterator as predicate searching.

DOCUMENTATION:: API GUIDE:: SELF-DOCUMENTING CODE WIHT PHPDOCUMENTOR
We use PHPDOC (included in Pear) to document the code: http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLframesConverter/default/

Each file should have the following at the top:

/* vim: set expandtab tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4: */
/**
 * @package KeyValueCoding
 * @subpackage Bindings
 * @copyright Copyright (c) 2005 Alan Pinstein. All Rights Reserved.
 * @version $Id: kvcoding.php,v 1.3 2004/12/12 02:44:09 alanpinstein Exp $
 * @author Alan Pinstein <apinstein@mac.com>                        
 */

The Package should be the section of the framework that you're working on. The default is framework-base, so use that if it's something basic.
Here are the top-level packages so far (no spaces allowed)
framework-base
KeyValueCoding
UI
WebApplication

Subpackages are just for useful navigation within the packages. Do what makes sense, but start with Captial SubPackage Names!

BUILD SYSTEM:
The "phocoa" script wraps phing which is used to do project tasks such as creating new modules, pages, and code-gen from propel.

CONVENTIONS

CLASS NAMES
WF<ClassName>

WF = "Web Framework"

FUNCTION NAMING - use title case, start with lowercase
sampleFunctionName()

This naming convention is purposely different from the php naming convention so that you can easily tell the difference between framework functions and php functions.

INTERFACES / PROTOCOLS
Our web framework uses many techniques similar to Apple's Cocoa environment. One of the is the use of PROTOCOLS, both FORMAL and INFORMAL. In PHP, the FORMAL protocols are defined / implemented as PHP5 interfaces. INFORMAL protocols (protocols where not ALL methods must be implemented, common for delegates) are defined as PHP interfaces, but in implemention, you only add the methods, you do not do "implements WFBlahProtocol".

Informal protocols for delegates are typically defined (basically for documentation purposes) as PHP classes ending in Delegate. For instance, WFWebApplicationDelegate.

INCLUDES
All script files should start with:

require '../relative-path-to/conf/webapp.conf';

Alternatively, you can use:

require $_ENV['PHOCOA_PROJECT_CONF'];

And just define that in the ENV before running your script.

This one include will set up the PHP include_path so that all remaining includes can be done as relative to the root directory of the project. This is true for CLI scripts as well.

----------------------------------

Generating tags files from the source: (BTW these are all good candiates for the PHING build system!)
cd to webframework
ctags -R

Generating PHPDoc (PhpDocumentor 1.3.0 stable is suggested)
cd to phocoa 
/sw/bin/phpdoc -dn framework-base -t docs/phpdocs -ti "PHOCOA Documentation" --ignore 'test' -d 'docs/tutorials,framework,smarty/plugins' -f 'conf/webapp.conf'

PROPEL
To use propel, need to include the PHOCOA code and make Propel's BaseObject.php extend WFObject. Be sure to include via FRAMEWORK_DIR rather than hard-coded so that multiple instances can live on a single server.

ERROR HANDLING
Should we have a WFException class? This class would have the following properties:
- errorActions (LOG, EMAIL)
- severity (WARN, FATAL)
Methods:
handleException($e)
  if LOG, LOG error
  if EMAIL, email error
  if FATAL, display error and halt execution
    - display error on development, display nice page on production
  if WARNING, procede (of course client can re-throw)

** maybe the LOG/EMAIL thing should be a site-wide config?

GENERAL

USERLAND
For several things need a userland solution so that framework can be updated independently and harmlessly from main application.
--> templates (ie errors, dynamic smarty template, page not found, etc)
--> modules (maybe a contrib directory will include all bundled ones? system will check modules first, then check APP/contrib/modules to allow overriding?)

FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE
- Need to decide about full-path-widget-ids (ie myForm.name vs name so we can have form-based namespaces) NO just make them all unique.

LIST OF DIFFERENCES FROM COCOA, for helping people who know Cocoa.
1) NSControl / NSCell - These are used heavily in Cocoa to handle the UI. All NSControls are NSView subclasses, which adds lots of overhead. Cocoa also has NSCell classes which handle a lot of the events and drawing. Since we don't have to deal with complex UI event handling (ie mouse tracking, etc), we have only NSControls for the UI.
2) Bindings - We don't implement KVO (Key-Value Observing) because we aren't a real-time interactive system. HTTP requests and forms essentially "batch" changes and then repaint the entire screen. So instead of having everything real-time, we simply use bindings ONCE on the way in (to restore the WFRequestView) and once on the way out (so the UI controls can "grab" their proper values).

Another reason for this is that Obj-C runtime can intercept calls to setXXX() and trigger observing events. We can't do that from PHP. Delaying the "reading" of bound data until after the code has run allows developers to use setXXX() calls and still have the values reflected in the UI.
NOTE: Examine ArrayAccess interface; this may allow us to detect calls, at least with $obj['propName'] = XXX syntax!
3) WFFormatters. Our formatters are linked in with the same error mechanism as the validators. In Cocoa, the formatters run in a real-time UI environment, and they can literally stop bad data from being entered. For us, they're more of a convenience item for display and validating well-known data types. This could change with AJAX.
